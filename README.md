# react-quick-reactions

Under construction! Currently a work-in-progress.

A lightweight popup component for quick reactions and emojis, à la GitHub's reaction popup or Facebook's "likes".

# Installation

```sh
$ npm install react-quick-reactions
```

Or with yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add react-quick-reactions
```
